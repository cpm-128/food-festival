## Key Takeaways
- Identify performance bottlenecks in web applications.
- Explain how performance can be measured in web applications.
- Explain the five main categories measured in a Lighthouse audit.
- Optimize CSS, JavaScript, and media assets for performance.
- Set up webpack in a new front-end project.
- Use service workers to cache assets for offline functionality.
- Convert an existing web application to a PWA.

## Tools
- **Google Lighthouse** is a tool that helps improve the performance of web applications by providing audits for performance, accessibility, Progressive Web Apps, and more. It's included in Chrome DevTools.
- **webpack** is a module bundler for JavaScript that simplifies front-end web development by generating static assets from modules with dependencies and using plugins and loaders to help automate certain optimization strategies. Youâ€™ll use the webpack (Links to an external site.) and webpack CLI packages in your project.
- The **webpack-bundle-analyzer** plugin allows you to visualize the size of webpack output files with an interactive zoomable treemap.
- The **file-loader** plugin resolves import/require() on a file into a URL and emits the file into the output directory.

- The **image-webpack-loader** plugin allows you to enhance your image-loading process.
- The **SW-precache-webpack** plugin allows you to use service workers to cache your external project dependencies. It will generate a service worker file, using sw-precache, and add it to your build directory.
-T he **webpack-PWA-manifest** plugin generates a manifest.json for your PWA, with auto icon resizing and fingerprinting support.
